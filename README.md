# holochain-client-csharp

using the following references, we can implement the beginnings of a conductor client library for C#.

- https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-rust
- https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js 
- https://github.com/Sprillow/electron-holochain-template/blob/main/web/src/simpleZomeClient.ts
- Basically a full implementation (but not working for dellams?) https://gist.github.com/Jakintosh/8578f39a66e50c4beb24bc34275e6ce5

Connor proposes that we run tests against https://github.com/holochain/happ-build-tutorial

There are a whole bunch of forum posts, Dev Camp discord chatter, and github issues that all precede and provide background on why to start this:
- https://github.com/holochain/holochain/issues/905
- (C++ but related) https://forum.holochain.org/t/wanted-a-c-client/6669


## Proposed API

One class which hosts the open websocket connection
  - reason, being able to hold open a persistent connection, and not needing to have many open connections with the conductor

One class which needs an instance of that websocket class passed to it, which is an abstraction over a Zome. So it is a Zome client. That way, one only needs to pass in an argument to make a zome call telling it which 'function' you wish to call in holochain. 

## HoloNET Code Has Migrated

This code was migrated from the main OASIS API/STAR Metaverse/HoloNET/.NET HDK code found here:
https://github.com/NextGenSoftwareUK/Our-World-OASIS-API-HoloNET-HoloUnity-And-.NET-HDK

### Background

Original HoloNET code (world's first .NET & Unity client for Holochain) written back in 2019 and was fully operational with the previous version of Holochain (Redux), but unfortuntley had issues getting it working with RSM. 

https://www.ourworldthegame.com/single-post/2019/08/14/world-exclusive-holochain-talking-to-unity

The previous version also came bundled with the holochain conductor so it could auto-start/shutdown the conductor and be fully integrated with any .NET or Unity application. This code/fuctionaility is still in there and will now work again that we have a Windows binary again (NixOS broke this feature previously).

It was featured on Dev Pulse 44 here:

https://www.ourworldthegame.com/single-post/2019/09/10/holonet-was-featured-in-the-latest-holochain-dev-pulse

### Current Issues

The current issue is to do with that the Holochain conductor not recognising the data format that is sent from the .NET MessagePack Serialiser. In the code you will find two different types, one is the fastest and most popular .NET MessagePack Serialiser (https://github.com/neuecc/MessagePack-CSharp). This is the one currently active. The other one (currently commented out) is the Unity one that was used by Jakintosh Unity implementation above but unfortunately even though I did my best to port this to .NET it appears not to be compatible because the data packets it sends are too small as spotted by @connor.

The WebSocket code is in it's own library/project and currently uses the one ported from the Unity project Jakintosh implemented. This one does appear to be compatible with .NET. The original HoloNET WebSocket code is still there and will likely be the one to be used again once we have tracked down what the issues are. I attempted to port both the WebSocket and MessagePack libraries uses in the Unity implementation to attempt to track down what the issue was.

As far as I can see the rest of the code is equivalent and is sending the same data formats etc across to the conductor. Currently the error message I get back from the Conductor is below:

```
‚Üê[1;34mhc-sandbox:‚Üê[0m Created ["C:\\Users\\david\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\IQUXzSuv8uMAoWMUaGz0A"]

‚Üê[2mFeb 02 20:37:13.728‚Üê[0m ‚Üê[31mERROR‚Üê[0m holochain_websocket::websocket: Websocket: Bad message type Pong([])
```

This is very odd because it appears it is expecting a U64 for the RequestType rather than a string?

Looking at Jakintosh code you can see that the request is surrounded by additional quotes:

```
[Serializable]
	public class WireMessage : RustEnum<byte[]> {

		public long id;

		public WireMessage (
			string type,
			byte[] data,
			long id
		) : base( type, data ) {
			this.id = id;
		}

		public override string ToString () => $"{{\n  type: \"{type}\",\n  id: {id},\n  data: {System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetString( data )}\n}}";
	}
```

If I attempt to do the same with the HoloNET code then I get back this error from the conductor:

```

```

This is as far as I have got to date so would appreciate any help I can get on this please, thank you. :)

You can view the full discussion going on since Aug to get this to work here:
https://github.com/holochain/holochain/issues/905

It actually goes back further than this but this is the latest thread regarding this... :)

### Why this is important & vital to the holochain community

This is really vital and important to the wonderful holochain commnity because it will open the doors to the massive .NET, Unity and Enterprise sectors bringing the flood of devs, resources and exposure we all really want holochain to see... :)

So I hope now this has been split out into it's own indepenent repo and been officially handed over to the holochain open source community others can now jump in and get involved...


### What's Next? 

#### NuGet Package & Unity Asset

Once we crack this nuget we can get it packaged up onto the .NET NuGet Package store as well as create a Unity Asset making it easier for other .NET & Unity devs to get involved with Holochain and get building hApps... 

#### .NET HDK Low Code Generator

We can then get back to the .NET HDK Low Code Generator (will migrate this <a href='https://github.com/NextGenSoftwareUK/Our-World-OASIS-API-HoloNET-HoloUnity-And-.NET-HDK/tree/master/NextGenSoftware.Holochain.HoloNET.HDK.Core'>repo</a> over to here soon...), this uses HoloNET to call into the dynamically generated rust and c# code. The rust code acts as a DAL (Data Access Layer) and the C# code acts as the BLL (Business Logic Layer). The generated C# code wraps around calls to HoloNET. This code has also already been written and is working with the previous version of Holochain (Redux).

This also allows devs to make use of all the libraries and resources available them in Rust, .NET & Unity! üòä

So it will not take long to get this working with RSM (we just need to create the RSM CRUD templates for it to use).

Then, we can add the WASM compilation option to allow it to directly generate the .NET code to WASM so it can be used directly with the conductor so it will not even need the rust code at all then! :)

All of this helps bring yet more C# devs to Holochain who do not have time to learn Rust... :)

#### Restore Holochain Support For The OASIS API

Once HoloNET is working the OASIS API will then once again support Holochain, which will allow bridging to other Blockchains, DB's etc such as Ethereum, EOS, Solana, MongoDB, SQLLite, Neo4j, ThreeFold, ActivityPub, SOLID, IPFS, etc...

#### STAR Metaverse

We can also then add Holochain support to the STAR Metaverse/Omniverse, which the back-end is very close to completion and the front-end is in progress... :)
